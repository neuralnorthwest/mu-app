# Contributing to Mu

To contribute, fork the repository and submit a pull request.

The main branch for development is `develop`. If you intend to submit PRs,
base them off of `develop`:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature develop
git push -u origin my-feature
```

If you find yourself frequently contributing to Mu, you can apply to become a
member of the `contributors` team. This will give you write access to the
repository, and allow you to create branches directly on the main repository
instead of your fork.

To apply, open an issue in the repository and ask to be added to the
`contributors` team.
